# 10

10 is a probability based game forked from 2048. You start with a 1 (probably) and you have to fill up boards by holding down the arrow keys.

The objective of the game is to get two 10 tiles and merge them together.

The game spawns all the tiles from 1-10 with increasing rarity. However, there are MANY other tiles the game can spawn, most of which are very rare.

As far as I am aware, the rarest tile that has ever been had is 53, sitting at 1 in every 4800000000 (4.8 billion) tiles.

Good luck, luck is all you need!
